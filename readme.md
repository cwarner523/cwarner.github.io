## The Beginning of Your Portfolio

### About Me

This weekend you're going to build an original About Me website that tells visitors, through content and design, more about your skills and personality. This will be the start of your portfolio, which you will use to showcase your projects throughout your time at GA. Think about your personal brand.  Its important to be authentic and utilize all technologies that are required. Also, recognize that it is an evolving thing that will be essential for a successful outcomes process.

You should create the files of `index.html`, `style.css`, and `reset.css` inside a **new Git repo**. 

**BONUS**: Make your new git repo on github.com instead of Github Enterprise and deploy your portfolio site to Github Pages! [Instructions on how to do that are here.](https://pages.github.com/)

**TIP**:  Plan ahead!  Take a few minutes to sketch or whiteboard a design. Challenge yourself!
